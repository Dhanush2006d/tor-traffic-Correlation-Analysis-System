Build a complete, run-ready full-stack forensic web application for probabilistic TOR traffic correlation analysis for a police cyber forensics hackathon.

IMPORTANT LEGAL AND TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS:
- This system must NOT claim TOR de-anonymization.
- All results must be clearly labeled as probabilistic correlation or origin association.
- Use simulated or sanitized data where required.
- Include clear forensic and legal disclaimers in the UI and generated reports.

BACKEND REQUIREMENTS:
- Python FastAPI backend
- SQLite database
- The application must run successfully inside Replit without additional configuration.

LIBRARIES TO USE:
- stem (TOR relay and node descriptor collection and simulation)
- pyshark (PCAP upload and packet timing/burst pattern analysis)
- pandas, numpy (analysis and scoring)
- networkx (TOR circuit graph modeling)
- reportlab (PDF forensic report generation)
- python-multipart (file uploads)
- hashlib (evidence integrity hashing)

BACKEND FEATURES:
1. TOR Node Management
   - Collect and simulate TOR relay descriptors using stem
   - Store fingerprint, nickname, masked IP, port, bandwidth, flags (Guard/Middle/Exit), uptime, and country
   - Demo button to generate simulated TOR nodes

2. Traffic Session Management
   - Create and manage traffic sessions automatically
   - Store packet-level data (timestamp, protocol, size, direction)
   - Support demo traffic generation and PCAP upload

3. PCAP Analysis
   - Accept PCAP file uploads
   - Use pyshark to extract timing, packet bursts, and protocol distribution
   - Map extracted data to TOR exit node activity

4. Correlation Engine
   - Time-window based correlation between exit node activity and entry/guard nodes
   - Adjustable sensitivity for time-window thresholds
   - Multi-session correlation support
   - Guard node persistence analysis
   - Pattern similarity detection using explainable statistical methods

5. Confidence Scoring and Explainability
   - Generate individual scores for:
     - Timing correlation
     - Traffic volume correlation
     - Pattern similarity
   - Produce overall confidence score (0–100%)
   - Generate human-readable justification explaining how the score was calculated

6. Analysis Output
   - Visualize probable TOR circuits (Entry → Middle → Exit)
   - Display masked or inferred probable origin association (clearly labeled as probabilistic)
   - Analyst notes field

7. Forensic Report Generation
   - Generate downloadable PDF forensic reports using reportlab
   - Include:
     - Case ID
     - TOR node and session details
     - Timeline reconstruction
     - Network path visualization
     - Confidence breakdown and justification
     - Evidence integrity hash (SHA-256)
     - Clear legal disclaimer

FRONTEND REQUIREMENTS:
- React frontend with dark cyber-forensics theme
- Ensure frontend fetches live data from backend APIs and updates dynamically

FRONTEND SECTIONS:
- Dashboard (system stats and demo controls)
- TOR Nodes (table with filters by node type and country)
- Timeline (traffic charts and packet tables)
- Analysis (PCAP upload, session selection, correlation execution, confidence gauge, network graph)
- Reports (list and download PDF forensic reports)

ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Enable CORS
- Provide FastAPI Swagger documentation at /docs
- Include demo data so the app works immediately after launch
- Ensure frontend and backend are fully integrated and functional

OUTPUT EXPECTATION:
- A complete, working application
- Ready for live demonstration using the Replit URL
- Suitable for TN Police Hackathon evaluation
