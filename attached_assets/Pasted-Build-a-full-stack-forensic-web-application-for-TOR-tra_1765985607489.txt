Build a full-stack forensic web application for TOR traffic correlation analysis for a police cyber forensics hackathon.

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
- This system must NOT claim TOR de-anonymization.
- It must use probabilistic, confidence-based traffic correlation only.
- Use simulated or sanitized data where required.
- Include clear forensic disclaimers in UI and reports.

BACKEND REQUIREMENTS:
- Python FastAPI backend
- SQLite database
- Use the following libraries:
  - stem (TOR relay and node descriptor collection)
  - pyshark (PCAP analysis and packet timing extraction)
  - pandas, numpy (analysis)
  - networkx (TOR path graph modeling)
  - reportlab (PDF report generation)
  - python-multipart (file uploads)

BACKEND FEATURES:
1. TOR Node Collection
   - Collect TOR relay descriptors (real or simulated) using stem
   - Store node fingerprint, nickname, IP (masked), port, bandwidth, flags (Guard/Middle/Exit), uptime, country
   - Endpoint to generate simulated TOR nodes for demo purposes

2. Traffic Session Management
   - Create traffic sessions automatically
   - Store packet-level data (timestamp, src/dst IP, protocol, size)
   - Support demo data generation and PCAP upload

3. PCAP Analysis (pyshark)
   - Upload PCAP files
   - Parse packet timing, burst patterns, protocol distribution
   - Map extracted timings to TOR exit node activity

4. Correlation Engine
   - Time-window based correlation between exit node activity and entry/guard nodes
   - Multi-session correlation support
   - Guard node persistence analysis
   - Pattern similarity detection using statistical methods
   - Adjustable sensitivity (time-window threshold)

5. Confidence Scoring
   - Break confidence into:
     - Timing correlation score
     - Traffic volume correlation score
     - Pattern similarity score
   - Generate overall confidence score (0–100%)
   - Include confidence justification text explaining contributing factors

6. Analysis Output
   - Probable TOR circuit visualization (Entry → Middle → Exit)
   - Probable origin IP shown as masked or inferred (clearly labeled as probabilistic)
   - Analyst notes field

7. Forensic Report Generation
   - Generate downloadable PDF report
   - Include:
     - Case ID
     - TOR node details
     - Timeline reconstruction
     - Network path visualization
     - Confidence score breakdown
     - Analysis justification
     - Evidence hash (SHA-256)
     - Legal disclaimer stating probabilistic correlation only

FRONTEND REQUIREMENTS:
- React frontend
- Professional cyber-forensics dark theme UI
- Navigation sections:
  - Dashboard
  - TOR Nodes
  - Timeline
  - Analysis
  - Reports

FRONTEND FEATURES:
1. Dashboard
   - Statistics: total nodes, sessions, analyses completed
   - Quick actions: generate demo data, run sample investigation

2. TOR Nodes View
   - Table of TOR nodes
   - Filters by node type (Guard/Middle/Exit) and country
   - Button to collect/generate nodes

3. Timeline View
   - Session selector
   - Traffic timeline chart (inbound/outbound over time)
   - Packet-level table view

4. Analysis View
   - PCAP upload option
   - Session selection
   - Run correlation analysis button
   - Network path visualization
   - Confidence gauge with breakdown
   - Confidence explanation panel
   - Guard persistence risk indicator

5. Reports View
   - List of completed analyses
   - Download full forensic report as PDF

ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Include CORS support
- Include API documentation via FastAPI /docs
- Include sample/demo data so the app works immediately
- Ensure the app runs fully inside Replit
- Use clear police-friendly language throughout the UI

OUTPUT:
- Generate the complete working application
- Backend and frontend fully connected
- Ready for live demo via Replit URL
